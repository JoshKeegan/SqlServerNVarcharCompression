SQL Server NVarchar Compression installation instructions.

Get SqlServerNVarcharCompression.dll and install.sql and copy them to 
your SQL Server.
The .dll can be compiled from source yourself, or downloaded pre-compiled.

Enable CLR integration on your SQL Server (if it isn't enabled already) with:
	sp_configure 'clr enabled', 1
	GO
	RECONFIGURE
	GO
Note that this requires the ALTER SETTINGS server level permission.

Open up Install.sql and edit @installDir to match the directory of the .dll
on your SQL Server.

Run Install.sql

Installation Complete!
